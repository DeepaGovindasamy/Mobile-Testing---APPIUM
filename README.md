# Scope and Objective
The scope of this exercise is to provide automated test solution to perform unit testing on the Mobile Device Applications. The functionalities validated include the below.
  > Picker Wheel / Scroll bar 
  > Contact List Sorting by First Name and Last Name, each separately
  > WIFI Network connectivity 
The below testing criterion are considered the base needs during the development and testing phase of this exercise.
  > Code is written in Java with TestNG and Gradle
  > PageObject / PageFactory structure is followed
  > Test cases are in passed status (except for any bug in the app)
# Automation Approach
The approach towards the development of this automated solution considers the following.
  > The automation package should enable testing across any remote mobile device in cloud 
  > The automation package should enable easy testing by different stakeholders such as developers and BA, with zero or minimum dependency     on testers. 
  > The suite is developed with Object Oriented approach with easy readable test cases for the stakeholders, and available in GITHub.
# Software/Hardware requirements
Following are the softwares to be installed for the delivered artifact to successfully run and deliver results.
  > Eclipse IDE
  > JDK 12.0
  > APPIUM plug-in for Eclipse
  > TestNG for Eclipse
  > Gradle for Eclipse
Note: The scripts are designed to run on the Remote Android mobile devices in the cloud environment “seetest.io”. Access Key is required to execute the tests.
# Test Execution
Clone  the repository to your machine and open it in Eclipse IDE. The test rely on an access key that allows  sending test requests to seetest.io.cloud. Access code has to be specified directly in code.
To run the tests from Eclipse IDE, either run the tests individually to run the test suite run through TestNG.xml .
